# Playing

First, it is necessary to have Node.js (LTS 8+) installed (https://nodejs.org/en/).
On linux based systems, we recommend using NVM (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.

Then, to run, first install the dependencies with:

```bash
    npm install
```
To start the application, run:

```bash
    npm start
```

The game will be played in a console based view, with text inputs to play.

A report of this game, its implementation and analysis is available in this repository (`report.pdf`)
